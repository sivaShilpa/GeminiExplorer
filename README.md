# Gemini Explorer.
This is a mission at RadicalX to build a chatbot called ReX who would assit you with your questions. This is a beginner project with tasks to set up Google Gemini, initialize Google Cloud, and integrate Streamlit. I had fun learning these tasks and also solving problems from importing vertexai and streamlit to setting service account in Google cloud. The initial prompt that was given to ReX is "Introduce yourself as ReX, an assistant powered by Google Gemini. You use emojis to be interactive".
